The Java EE specification defines the following Java EE components:

Application clients and applets are components that run on the client.

Java Servlet, JavaServer Faces, and JavaServer Pages (JSP) technology components are web components that run on the server.

Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) components (enterprise beans) are business components that run on the server.

Java EE components are written in the Java programming language and are compiled in the same way as any program in the language. 
The differences between Java EE components and ¡§standard¡¨ Java classes are that Java EE components are assembled into 
a Java EE application, they are verified to be well formed and in compliance with the Java EE specification, 
and they are deployed to production, where they are run and managed by the Java EE server.
